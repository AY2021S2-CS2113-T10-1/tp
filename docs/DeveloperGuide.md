# Developer Guide

## Introduction

`FridgeFriend` is an app for managing food in the fridge, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
If you can type fast, `FridgeFriend` can track your cold or frozen groceries faster and easier than any other apps.
It is written in Java, and has more than 3.2kLoC.

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)
The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. 
Given below is a quick overview of each component.


The Main driver class for the FridgeFriend app is
named **[`FridgeFriend`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/fridgefriend/FridgeFriend.java)**.
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.



The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`Utilities`**](#utilities-component): The main component containing the key driver classes in
  FridgeFriend, such as `Parser`, `UI`, and `Storage`.


* [**`Command`**](#command-component): Executes commands based on the input obtained
  and processed from `Parser` in `Utilities`. The list of executable commands can be found in our
  [User Guide](https://ay2021s2-cs2113-t10-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html).


* [**`Food`**](#food-component) represents a collection of classes used by the FridgeFriend application.
  Food objects are instantiated by the `Command` Component. Once a `Food` object is created,
  it may be stored to disk using the `Storage` function in `Utilities`.


* [**`Exception`**](#exception-component) represents a collection of classes that represent potential
  exception events that may occur during the usage of `FridgeFriend`. The `Exception` component
  facilitates the return of exceptions to the `UI` class in `Utilities`, which will display
  the error message to the user.

### Command Component

The Command component contains the sub classes of the features that will be executed.

The command Object is executed by the main method in FridgeFriend.
The execution of the command can affect the fridge.
After the execution, the results of the command object is pass to the UI.
The results of the command instruct the Ui to display the message return to the user.

![Command Class Diagram](diagrams/diagram_images/CommandClass.png)

The ***Command Class Diagram*** given above shows how the Command interact with Fridge. 

The Command Component consist of 10 sub class which each command represents a features. 

* **AddCommand**: Add a food object to the fridge when executed.
* **RemoveCommand**: Remove a portion of food quantity from a particular food in the fridge when executed.
* **ListCommand**: List details of food either by a category, storage location or all off it when executed.
* **SearchCommand**: Search for the details of the food. 
* **ExpiringCommand**: Provide the list of item that is expiring in a week when executed. 
* **ClearCommand**: Clear the list of food objects in the fridge object.
* **HelpCommand**: List the instruction on how to use all the commands in FridgeFriend.
* **RunningLowCommand**: Provide the food category that are running low compare to the limit set in the Food Category.
* **SetLimitCommand**: Change the default quantity limit in that particular Food Category.
* **ByeCommand**: Indicate to the main method to exit the program. 

### Utilities Compoenent

The Utilities component contains the main classes that run the main functions of FridgeFriend.

![Utilities Class Diagram](diagrams/diagram_images/UtilitiesClassDiagram.png)

The ***Utilities Class Diagram*** given above shows how the classes in the Utilities component interact with each other and classes from other component.

The Utilities Component consists for 4 classes.

- **`LoggingHandler`**: Logs information during execution to the console.
- **`Parser`**: Breaks down user input into relevant objects.
- **`Storage`**: Reads data from, and writes data to, the local disk.
- **`Ui`**: Handles the input and output of the application.
