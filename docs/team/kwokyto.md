## Overview

This is a student project for university software development course.
I am one of the contributors to the `FridgeFriend` project.

## Project: `FridgeFriend`

`FridgeFriend` is an app for managing food in the fridge, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
If you can type fast, `FridgeFriend` can track your cold or frozen groceries faster and easier than any other apps.
It is written in Java, and has more than 1.5kLoC.
